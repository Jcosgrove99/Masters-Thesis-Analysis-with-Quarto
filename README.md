This Repo contains my analysis, slides, quarto code, and final pdf of my economics masters thesis: "Tempers Rising: The effect of Temperature on Spite"

The scope of my work looked at answering the research question: does heat directly effect spiteful behavior? We use a data set that I particpated in collecting through an RCT that controlled the temperature of the experimental room while indiviudals answered an economic behavior experiemnt. The code in this repo shows anslysis in R and python implimenting: 
1. Casual Analysis with OLS 
2. Machine Learning for Heterogenous Treatment Effects: 
        a. Casual Forest 
        b. Generic Machine Learning 
        c. Linear Regression to predict individual treatment effects 
3. Data Visulizations
4. Quarto Code to create final paper pdf and online version
